BlueChickensInMultiplayer

Mod for Stardew Valley 1.3 Beta

This mod adds functionality to the game that allows players to get Blue Chickens in multiplayer mode, which usually isn't possible.  The conditions for getting those chickens are unchanged, but after any player (host or farmhand) sees the 8-heart event with Shane, Blue Chickens will be available to everyone.

Note: When purchasing chickens, you still will only see brown or white chickens at the naming screen.  However, there will still be a 25% chance that it will be a Blue Chicken once you actually get it.  Chicken will turn blue the next morning.  This is the only deviation from the base game.
